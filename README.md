# Media Upload Processor

1) Swith to Core database and navigate to:"/sitecore/content/Applications/Content Editor/Editors/Media/Media Folder"
2) Create new button item, you can duplicate "Classic Upload - Simple", and change the item name and title to be "Upload file with Date"
3) I am using "File Date" Field in my sample, but this field needs to be changed based on your template for the PDF File:
   <img width="718" height="620" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eef5da4-5a37-481b-a7a2-64ae82594334" />
 4) Deploy the github code to your sitecore instance.
